What is recursion
How to implement recursion
In what situations you should implement recursion
In what situations you shouldnt implement recursion


0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget

Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more

0-puts_recursion.c



1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together

Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

1-print_rev_recursion.c


2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange

Write a function that returns the length of a string

The standard library provides a similar function: strlen. Run man strlen to learn more.


2-strlen_recursion.c


3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling

Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number

3-factorial.c


4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate

Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y
The standard library provides a different function: pow. Run man pow to learn more

4-pow_recursion.c


5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer

Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number

The standard library provides a different function: sqrt. Run man sqrt to learn more

 5-sqrt_recursion.c



6. Inception. Is it possible?

Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0

6-is_prime_number.c



7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything

Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not

7-is_palindrome.c



8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...

Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0
